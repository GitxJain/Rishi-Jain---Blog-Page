    <h2>My JEE journey</h2>
    <p id="para">
        For those living under a rock , JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) , is one of the toughest competitive exams
        of India , which comprises of three subjects , Physics , Chemistry , Maths. It's a 3 hour , MCQ format examination , 
        which tests your fundamentals of science and gauges how well you are able to apply them in various real life problems.
        Students prepare for this one exam , for serious durations of time , ranging from 2 to 5 years ! If this doesn't tell you 
        the complexity of the exam , I dont know what will. So my 11th standard began , and so did my JEE prep. Initially , 
        I was unable to digest the pattern of learning. In school , all we did was learn and spill in our exams. It was quick and easy
        and things were dealt with good pace , without any second thought. Here , when I saw that each concept takes up a week to swallow , 
        I couldn't handle it . This lead me to have serious depression in the first seven months of my JEE preparation , and a lot of other 
        personal problems added to my troubles. Then , in the 12th grade , it was go hard or go home , and I ain't tryna go home . So , 
        I went crazy with my preparation , studying 6-7 hours a day , solving past year papers , reading world class textbooks to 
        understand the fundamentals. Lastly , after various ups and downs , I gave my JEE Mains and Advanced , and cleared both. I gave CET
        as a backup exam , and turns out this only helped me secure admission into DJ Sanghavi College of Engineering. These 2 years
        have taught me a lot about discipline , human relationships , will power etc. I highly recommend someone pursuing science to live 
        these 2 years of JEE , it was absolutely worth it!
